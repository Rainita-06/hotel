## Data Migration Process

### Export (Current System)

1. Run [export_data.py](file:///c%3A/Users/varun/Desktop/Victoireus%20internship/hotel_project/export_data.py) on your current system to create a SQL dump
2. Transfer the generated SQL file to your new deployment server

### Import (New Docker Environment)

1. Run [import_data.py](file:///c%3A/Users/varun/Desktop/Victoireus%20internship/hotel_project/import_data.py) in your new Docker environment
2. The script will automatically:
   - Copy the SQL file to the database container
   - Import the data
   - Run Django migrations
   - Collect static files

### Verification

1. Test the application by accessing it in your browser
2. Create a superuser if needed:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it hotel_web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
3. Verify all data is present and correct

## Docker Environment Files

All Docker environment files have been properly configured with:
- Health checks for all services
- Environment variable support
- Proper secret key escaping
- Multi-environment support (dev, test, prod)

## Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions in [DATA_MIGRATION_README.md](file:///c%3A/Users/varun/Desktop/Victoireus%20internship/hotel_project/DATA_MIGRATION_README.md) to migrate your data
2. Test the application thoroughly after migration
3. Remove the migration scripts after successful migration if desired
